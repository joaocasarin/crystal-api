# Travel Plans API

The Travel Plans API allows users to create travel plans through different locations and dimensions of the Rick and Morty show. Users can provide a list of locations and retrieve them later. The API supports options to expand the response with detailed location information and optimize the travel plan based on popularity.

## Installation

1. Install Crystal language by following the instructions for your operating system as available on [Crystal website](https://crystal-lang.org/install/). (e.g., macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL) 
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

## Libraries

The Travel Plans API is built using the following technologies:

- Framework: Amber
- ORM: Granite
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

To launch the API and database, run the following command `docker compose up -d`.

This will start the PostgreSQL database on port 5432 and the application on port 3000.

Alternatively, if you have the database running locally or in another container, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies: `shards install`
2. Run migrations: `amber db migrate`
3. Run the application: `amber watch`

The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000` and will watch for any changes in the project files.
